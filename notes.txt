1: Added the route to the currentLocationInfo PHP file but need to fill in the rest of it

2: Need to create the current location info section in the HTML file

3: Tidy up the script.js file as it looks shit

4: The latitude and longitude data is in the leaflet.js file, this loands on initial load

5: Sort out the locationInformation.php file as the url isnt doing anything, maybe swap it with the other
    php file to fill in the current location data

6: Now got the location working from the initial load - Juts add any more boxs i may need.

7: now need to add the weather info

8: to make the weather icon work, you need to add the code in dynamically to make sure it shows the correct
   icon
